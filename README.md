Laravel Helpers for Bash
========================

Execute `artisan`, `gulp` and `phpunit` from anywhere (within your project).  
Also, you don't need `gulp` installed globally anymore.

### Installation
 - You can, for example, append the script to your .bashrc:
```bash
cat laravel-helpers.sh >> ~/.bashrc
```
 - Open a new terminal.
